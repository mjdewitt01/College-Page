					<p style="font-size: 36px; color: white;"> The College Walk <br> Experimental Video Edit, 1920x1080 <br>
						This project is a representation of a typical college student's experience--this includes the good, the bad, and the ugly. Every student has different personal experiences during their college days, but their are certain things they can still relate to
						with each other. This video showcases the good and bad sides of being a college student in today's times while stressing that all sides are necessary for growth and success once it is all said and done. 
						There are many realities we have to face when being a student and I was trying to put these realities on display with transparency.
